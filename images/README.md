# Images

> [!NOTE]
> This directory contains the configuration files consumed by the build pipeline.

The [Common](../images/base/common.yaml) configuration file is the base configuration file for all images. So all you need to do is include the common configuration file in your image configuration file.

```yaml
include: ../base/common.yaml
